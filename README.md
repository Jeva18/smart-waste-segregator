Improper waste disposal is one of the most persistent problems in the Philippines, leading to pollution, flooding, and health issues.  

The **Smart Waste Segregator** aims to:  
- Encourage **proper waste segregation** by making it automatic and effortless  
- Reduce landfill volume through accurate classification of recyclable, residual, and biodegradable waste  
- Support **sustainability goals** in schools, communities, and cities  
- Lay the foundation for **future smart city waste management systems**  

By combining AI, fuzzy logic, and embedded systems, this project shows how technology can create real-world impact in building cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable communities.
